  <section class="who_am_i">
    <h2>Who I am</h2>
    <p>I am Afolashade Joy Jubrilla, a risk, compliance, and governance professional dedicated to building systems that protect people, strengthen institutions, and create fair opportunities for communities. My work sits at the intersection of financial crime prevention, operational excellence, and human centered policy.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I began my career in banking, where I supported customers, resolved complex claims, and worked directly with frontline teams. Over time, my work expanded into KYC and customer due diligence, fraud prevention, AML and CFT investigation, operational risk, and documentation quality. Across these roles, one truth became clear to me. Good systems are built on understanding people. When people are supported, trained, and trusted, compliance becomes culture, not a checklist.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I have spent almost a decade working across the heart of financial crime prevention. I have handled account takeovers, social engineering cases, elder financial exploitation, deposit and check fraud, payment abuse, sanctions alerts, politically exposed person reviews, and high risk customer escalations. I have also worked across major remediation projects, designed documentation quality controls, and created operational tools that reduced rework, increased clarity, and supported stronger governance.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My desire to understand people and systems more deeply led me to pursue a Master of Arts in Governance and Policy Development at the International Institute of Social Studies of Erasmus University. My research focused on inclusion, representation, and access. I studied how communities make decisions, how power shapes opportunities, and how governance can either include or exclude. My study on the Awori community explored political participation and fairness in selection processes. My fieldwork in Makoko examined education access, dignity, and community led development.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Beyond work, I mentor young professionals, support vulnerable communities, and speak about education, opportunity, and human dignity. I believe that awareness and empathy are powerful tools for change. I believe in environments where people are free to think, grow, and express themselves without fear. I believe strong systems do not suppress people. They empower them.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I show up with purpose and presence, ready to build, learn, and elevate the people and spaces I am trusted to serve. Because in the end, we rise when we help others rise.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>My approach is simple:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Build systems that scale.</li>
      <li>Equip people so excellence feels natural.</li>
      <li>Solve problems at their source rather than at the outcome.</li>
      <li>Bridge leadership vision with analyst reality.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>I believe strong fraud and compliance programs grow from both directions. Leaders must listen, and analysts must be empowered. When both work together, prevention becomes culture rather than a task list.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Above all, I show up ready to learn, build, and elevate every environment I step into.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As Robert Ingersoll wisely said, “We rise by lifting others.” This reflects my values, my leadership philosophy, and the way I choose to contribute to safer and more inclusive financial ecosystems.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I welcome opportunities to connect with professionals who believe that awareness, inclusion, and accountability are essential to building systems that protect people and strengthen the societies we live in.</p>
